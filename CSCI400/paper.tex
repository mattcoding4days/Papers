\title{Decentralized Finance and the Ethical Problems it Solves}

\abstract{The history of traditional centralized finance is wrought with inequality, fancy nomenclature,
exclusionary jargon, and has left the world with an imbalanced void. According to \textcite{jeff_desj_2019} ``Globally,
about 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, without an account at a financial institution or through a mobile
money provider.'' During a time of financial illiteracy and a growing wealth gap, it is clear that new solutions are needed.
Over the past few years, a flock of \emph{DEFI} (Decentralized Finance) companies has
been aiming to solve modern financial problems with fresh perspectives and blockchain technologies.
However, with \emph{DEFI} still being in its infancy, stakeholders from all sides have been sprinting
towards the cause with arms wide open or pitchforks drawn. With the post WW2 boomer economy coming to an end,
we will look at what \emph{DEFI} is, how it works, the technical and ethical problems it solves,
and the issues that it faces going forward.
